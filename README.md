# RFJSON
-----
RFJSON is a simple edit of https://github.com/rxi/json.lua by rxi. Modifications only include getting the original code to work with Ravenscript's eco system.

**I do not own the original json.lua implementation.**

# How To Use It
To use this just drag the **RFJson** prefab into your mutator prefab. To use it, just simply access the global **rfjson** table.

The class has two functions: **rfjson:encode(value)** and **rfjson:decode(str)**. You can look at the JsonTesting.lua file. You may look at the quick documentation in the original version linked above as well.
